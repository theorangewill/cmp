## CMP - Common-midpoint seismic method
This is a seismic algorithm.

It is defined as: "A recording-processing method where each source is recorded at a number of geophone locations and each geophone location is used to record from a number of source locations. After correcting these data for statics, normal moveout, and DMO [...], they are combined (stacked) to provide a common-midpoint section that approximates the traces that would be recorded by a coincident source and receiver at each location, but with improved discrimination against noise. The objective is to attenuate random effects and events whose dependence on offset is different from that of primary reflections."

## Seismic Unix
The Seismic Unix is a open source seismic processing package. It uses a specific data syntax, the same that this program uses.
